abstract: Recent advancements in information technology and wearable devices have revolutionized healthcare through health data analysis. Identifying significant relationships in complex health data enhances healthcare and public health strategies. In health analytics, causal graphs are important for investigating the relationships among health features. However, they face challenges owing to the large number of features, complexity, and computational demands. Feature selection methods are useful for addressing these challenges. In this paper, we present a framework for multiple feature selection based on an optimization strategy for causal analysis of health data. We select multiple health features based on an optimization strategy. First, we define a Weighted Total Score (WTS) index to assess the feature importance after the combination of different feature selection methods. To explore an optimal set of weights for each method, we design a multiple feature selection algorithm integrated with the greedy algorithm. The features are then ranked according to their WTS, enabling selection of the most important ones. After that, causal graphs are constructed based on the selected features, and the statistical significance of the paths is assessed. Furthermore, evaluation experiments are conducted on an experiment dataset collected for this study and an open dataset for diabetes. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms baseline models by reducing the number of features while improving model performance. Moreover, the statistical significance of the relationships between features uncovered through causal graphs is validated for both datasets. By using the proposed framework for multiple feature selection based on an optimization strategy for causal analysis, the number of features is reduced and the causal relationships are uncovered and validated.

abstract: The identification of latent risk factors that can induce to health risks or an abnormal status is an important task in healthcare data analyses. In recent years, health analyses based on neural network models have been applied widely. However, such analysis processes are blackbox and the results lack explainability. Some approaches by constructing a domain model may tackle these issues. However, domain knowledge from an expert is required. In this study, we propose an exploratory and interpretable approach to estimating latent health risk factors without relying on domain knowledge, in which feature selection and causal discovery are used to construct a domain model for uncovering complex relationships in health and medical data. An evaluation experiment conducted on two datasets by comparing the proposed approach with four baselines demonstrated that the proposed approach outperformed the baselines in terms of model fitness. Furthermore, the number of model parameters in our method was smaller than that in the baselines, which reduced model complexity. Moreover, the analysis process of the proposed approach was visible and explainable, which improved the interpretability of the analysis processes.
